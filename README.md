# Wind Turbines Analysis and Analytics of Power Generation by using Long Short Term Memory
________________________________________
## *Abstract:*
In this paper, the study of the behavior of wind turbines and its power generation in Germany that an important source for renewable energy is investigated. This work develops a deep learning recurrent neural model that depends on time series modeling to predict the power generation of wind turbines (WT) in every ten mins in a daily basis, and seasonal behavior. The proposed model uses previous historical power data from the turbines and the dependency of short-term points and long-term behavior that common in time series with its probabilistic behavior. However, WT power generation depends on wind speed, torque, gearbox state, temperature that are highly correlated to power generated and WT state in generation, but time series modeling uses the historical previous power generated only to forecast the future behavior that behaves in a pattern similar to the previous corresponding time frame. The comprehensive analysis is implemented to evaluate the suggested model with previous data and then forecast the power generated in the last months of the year.
